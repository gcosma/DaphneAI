## Evaluation (placeholder)

Sketch of how to report and compare performance by document type.

- Datasets: list document types and sample sizes once defined (e.g., coroners’ reports, institutional reports).
- Metrics: alignment accuracy (matched/partial/none), recommendation recall, search precision/recall per mode.
- Procedure: describe ingestion, search configuration, extraction/alignment steps, and how scores are computed.
- Results: summarize per document type; highlight failure modes and qualitative observations.
- Reproducibility: note configs, model versions, and thresholds used in experiments.
