# DEPLOYMENT NOTES
# ===============================================

# For Local Development:
# - All dependencies above work fine
# - Models will download automatically on first run (~1.5GB)
# - Recommend 4GB+ RAM for optimal performance

# For Streamlit Cloud:
# - sentence-transformers may take longer to install
# - torch download is large but should work
# - Consider using smaller models if deployment fails

# For Production:
# - Pre-download models to avoid startup delays
# - Consider model caching strategies
# - Monitor memory usage with large documents
